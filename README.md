# Airline Company Data Warehouse
 ## Data Warehouse modeling, design, implementation, and analysis for an Airline Company.
### This project is a real treasure for any one struggling to understand data warehouse concepts, modeling, design, implementation, data integration, or even SQL DML Statements, as it will walk you from square zero having nothing, into having a well-structured data warehouse, helping you along the side to understand all about data warehousing.

<br>

#### The project is implemented in SQL SERVER Database, and I have attached both the DWH creation & Data population scripts, but for simplicity I have also attached a backup file of the data warehouse, you can restore it in SQL Server Management Studio.

**Letâ€™s start what we will do:**
- First, I will do my research to understand how airline companies work and what are
the main business processes we are interested in analyzing.
- Then, I will gather some of the questions that we need our model to answer.
- Then we will dive into the modeling process, defining the dimensions, facts,
measurements, granularity, sparsity, and summarizability issues for our model.
- Next step will be designing the schema for our model.
- Then I will collect some data to populate into the data warehouse.
- Next step, I will integrate the data into the database (SQL SERVER Database).
- Before diving into the analysis, I will spend some time talking about indexes.
- The last step is what we are doing all those steps for, which is analyzing the data
warehouse and getting interesting insights to help the Management Team make
data-driven decisions.
